*   
*   What are primes?
*       Primes are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
*       The number 17 is a prime because it not evenly divisible.
*
*   How to check if a number is prime?
*       Using the modulus operator along with a for loop is the most practical way.
*       With the modulus operator we can find the remainder of any divison.
*       If this returns 0 and the number is not 1 or itself the number is not prime.
*       
*       For numbers under 25 you could simply check if its divisible by 2 or 3 if it is its
*       not a prime.
*       Past that we will need to use a for loop to go through every number below x and
*       see if x is divisble by that number.
*
*       Below I wrote some sample code you can try in order to understand this better
*       To test it simply run the code and follow the prompt.
